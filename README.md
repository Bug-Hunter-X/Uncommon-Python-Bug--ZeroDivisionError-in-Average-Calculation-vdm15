This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a subtle bug related to division by zero when calculating the average of a list of numbers. The bug occurs when the input list is empty.  The original code attempts to handle this scenario, but the returned value of 0 might not always be the correct or expected outcome.  The solution demonstrates a more robust way to deal with edge cases.
